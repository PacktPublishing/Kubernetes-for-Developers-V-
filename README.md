# Kubernetes-for-Developers-V
This is the code repository for [Kubernetes for Developers [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/kubernetes-developers-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Kubernetes is a powerful tool developed by Google for managing containerized applications in a clustered environment. Kubernetes helps you automate, deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications. It gives you the freedom to take advantage of on-premise cloud infrastructures. It also helps you write better cloud-native applications.

This course will give you detailed instructions, real-world examples, and helpful advice. We will begin by learning to set up the development environment on your local machine. Then move on to package your code into Kubernetes, and manage container lifecycles. Once you get a grip in understanding the RBAC Authorization, very easily explore the monitoring techniques with Prometheus and troubleshoot your service account. Finally you will learn to create a cluster in your Google Cloud Environment and deploy your application in production.

By the end of this video, you will develop, run, test, and deploy your application in the cloud, utilizing the power of Kubernetes to its full potential.
